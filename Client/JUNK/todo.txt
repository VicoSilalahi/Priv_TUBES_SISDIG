1. CSV to HEX
	An input prompt will ask for a file name of the csv, the prompt: "Input the file name: " (The input will include the .csv). This file will then be converted to HEX into one file, msb first will be converted, e.g. (in a 256 bits file, 255..128 will exhibit the first line, and the rest, 127..0 will exhibit the second line, and so on)
	in the case where the file is not a multiple of 128-bit, let's say 370-bit. The LSB will be padded by 0 in binary before converted to HEX.
	for now, output the HEX into a file named "output_hex.txt"
2. UART Transmit and Receive
	use COM3
	make use of threading to both transmit and receive to and from FPGA.
	first create an input field to get a 128-bit data to transmit first, make the prompt "Enter Masterkey (32 Hex): "
	second open the "output_hex.txt" and get the first line
	when an enter key is pressed, transmit the first line (128-bit of 32 HEX, without the newline character)
	at this point the FPGA will send a 128-bit data. Please make a new file called "capture_hex.txt" that will be overwritten everytime this program is open, each 128-bit will be in its own line.
	after the transmit move to the second line of "output_hex.txt" and await the enter key
	When instead of only enter key (therefore a blank input), an input of "exit" is received, close the transmitter. Save the "capture_hext.txt" and return to main menu
3. Exit
	Close port and other stuff that needs to be done
